# Apparatus
Unofficial decompilation of the mobile game Apparatus, currently based off of a decompilation of Apparatus 1.2.2 Beta 1.

## Building
At the moment, it does not compile. You could however work on fixing errors which would inch us closer to being able to compile it.

1. Install Android SDK (the command-line tools should suffice)
2. Add LibGDX 0.9.9 along with its Android backend to a `libs.jar` file in `app/`
3. Run ./gradlew build
